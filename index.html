    <p>Although they once roamed over a large portion of Asia, scientists currently estimate the population of wild
        Giant Pandas at only 1,864, making Giant Pandas a seriously vulnerable species. They are found living in the
        wild in a small area in Southwestern China along the Tibetan Plateau.</p>
    <p>There are approximately 600 in captivity in panda centers, zoos and wild life parks. Three zoos in the US
        currently have pandas; Memphis, Atlanta and Washington D.C. Giant Pandas are also found in zoos in Australia,
        Canada, Japan, Finland, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan, Mexico, France, Singapore, Spain, Austria,
        Belgium, Russia and the United Kingdom. Zoos outside of China must lease the animals from the Chinese
        government. This money is used for the preservation of the wild Giant Pandas.</p>
